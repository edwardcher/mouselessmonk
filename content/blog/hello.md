Restarting my blog on GitHub Pages. I like the fact that everything is in Markdown and I can use my favourite text editor(s) i.e. vim or emacs to create content. My content at **[typepad](http://edwardcher.typepad.com)** has stagnated largely due to my working environment. 

I am using Hugo and Markdown for my new blogging backend because it is more suited to my day to day workflow. Everybody that understands me know I prefer to live inside the console/terminal :) 

For the first time in a very long time I am looking forward to blogging again to share ideas, experiences, and dump my thoughts just to breaking my echo chamber.
